Foin More
=============

Setup
---------------------
Foin More is experimental Foin client and it builds the backbone of the network. However, it downloads and stores the entire history of Foin transactions (which is currently several GBs); depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more.

To download Foin More, visit [foinmore.org](https://foinmore.org).

Running
---------------------
The following are some helpful notes on how to run Foin on your native platform.

### Unix

Unpack the files into a directory and run:

- `bin/foin-qt` (GUI) or
- `bin/foind` (headless)

### Windows

Unpack the files into a directory, and then run foin-qt.exe.

### OS X

Drag Foin-More to your applications folder, and then run Foin-More.
